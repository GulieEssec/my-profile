		<h2>Who am I? 🤔 </h2>
		<p>
			You just read it, but a good reminder is never too much : my name is Julie Bonnetot. I am 18 years old and I am currently studying at Essec Business School in the BBA Program. I live in Paris 🗼 with both my parents and my twin brother, but I have lived most of my life in Brussels, so I'm Franco-Belgian 🇧🇪😆🇫🇷 !

		<h2>What are my passions ?</h2>

		<h3>Sport 🏐 </h3>
		<p>
			I have always been a really sportive person : when I was young, I did judo, basketball 🏀, volleyball 🏐, swimming 🏊🏻, running... So yeah, you can call me a sportive person!
		</p>

		<h3>Music 🎶 </h3>
		<p>
			I come from a quite music enthusiast's family. My parents initated me to music when I was 7: I started music theory and the recorder . When I finished my learning in both subjects, I started to play the piano 🎹 and the guitar 🎸, and I joined the choir of my music academy.
			I pretty much like every musical genre : from classical to rap, you can make me listen to everything.

		<h3> Traveling ✈️ </h3>
		<p>
			As said before, I have lived 4 years in France 🇫🇷, 13 in Belgium 🇧🇪, and one in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧. I also have travelled around the world : Egypt, Thaïland, USA, Germany... I really enjoy discovering new cultures and new environments 🌍.

		<h3> Reading 📚 </h3>
		<p>
			I hesitated a long time to do a khâgne 📕(literary preparatory class), but as you can, see, I finally chose a business school 📊. My favorite subjects in highschool were french, philosophy, history, geography and the languages. I really miss those subjects today, and eventhough I read on my own, I miss analyzing and dissect the textes I read.
